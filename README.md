In this project, we plan to reimplement the method described in Przybyl et al.'s paper “Application of Machine Learning to Assess the Quality of Food Products—Case Study: Coffee Bean”. We are reimplementing elements of a paper which sought to automate and improve quality indexing for coffee beans. Given the importance of tea leaves within our own culture, we would like to harness similar DL techniques we have learnt to rate the quality of tea leaves. 

As mentioned, we based our project on Przybyl et al.'s paper, which explores the use of modern machine learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to enhance the quality assessment of coffee beans, focusing on Arabica coffee. 
While their code was not openly accessible, we found a few public implementations (see below) online which classified our dataset. We were inspired by elements of their model architecture while ensuring to use a similar process to that in our initial paper.
